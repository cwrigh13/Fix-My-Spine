## 1. Foundational Klaviyo Setup

### List & Segmentation Strategy

**Initial List Import Process:**
1. **Data Export from Database**: Extract practitioner data from your `users` and `businesses` tables, focusing on practitioners with `listing_tier = 'free'` and `is_approved = true`
2. **CSV Format for Import**: Structure the data with these essential columns:
   - Email (primary identifier)
   - First Name (extracted from `name` field)
   - Last Name (extracted from `name` field)
   - Practice Name (`business_name`)
   - Category (`category_name` from JOIN with categories table)
   - Suburb (`suburb` from JOIN with locations table)
   - State (`state` from JOIN with locations table)
   - Postcode (`postcode` from JOIN with locations table)
   - Registration Date (`created_at` from users table)
   - Listing Created Date (`created_at` from businesses table)

**Essential Custom Properties to Create in Klaviyo:**
- `PracticeName` (Text) - Business name for personalization
- `Category` (Text) - Chiropractor, Physiotherapist, Osteopath, etc.
- `Suburb` (Text) - Geographic location for local messaging
- `State` (Text) - State for regional campaigns
- `Postcode` (Text) - For hyper-local targeting
- `ListingTier` (Text) - Initially set to "Free" for all imports
- `RegistrationDate` (Date) - For lifecycle segmentation
- `ListingCreatedDate` (Date) - For engagement timing
- `BusinessAddress` (Text) - Full address for local SEO context
- `PhoneNumber` (Text) - Contact information
- `Website` (Text) - For traffic-driving campaigns
- `Description` (Text) - Practice description for personalization
- `LastLoginDate` (Date) - For engagement scoring
- `ProfileViews` (Number) - Performance metric
- `ReviewCount` (Number) - Social proof data
- `AverageRating` (Number) - Quality indicator

**Segmentation Strategy:**
1. **Primary Segments:**
   - **By Profession**: Chiropractors, Physiotherapists, Osteopaths, Massage Therapists
   - **By Geographic Location**: NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, NT, ACT

   - **By Engagement Level**: Active (logged in within 30 days), Inactive (no login in 90+ days)

2. **Advanced Segments:**
   - **High-Value Prospects**: Practices with websites, multiple locations, high review counts
   - **Local Competition**: Practitioners in suburbs with 3+ competitors
   - **Seasonal Segments**: Based on registration timing and practice type
   - **Performance-Based**: Practitioners with low profile views who could benefit from premium

### Email Template Design

**Send Timing**: 5 days after Email 3
**Objective**: Address common hesitations and provide ROI justification

**Subject Line**: "Is a premium listing worth it? We answer your top questions"

**Key Message Structure**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I know you're probably wondering: "Is premium really worth $399/year for my practice?"

Let me answer the questions we hear most often:

**"Will I actually get more patients?"**
Premium listings receive 5-7x more profile views on average. In [Suburb], premium practitioners report 40-60% more booking inquiries within the first 3 months.

**"What if it doesn't work for my practice?"**
We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't see results, we'll refund your payment in full.

**"Is $399/year too expensive?"**
Consider this: If premium brings you just 2 additional patients per month at $80 per visit, you're looking at $1,920 in additional revenue - nearly 5x your investment.

**"I'm already getting some patients from my free listing"**
That's great! It means FixMySpine works for your practice. Premium will amplify those results and help you reach patients who might not scroll down to find your free listing.

**"What if I want to cancel later?"**
No lock-in contracts. Cancel anytime and your premium features will remain active until the end of your paid period.

**"How quickly will I see results?"**
Most practitioners see increased profile views within 48 hours of upgrading. Booking increases typically happen within 2-4 weeks as patients discover your enhanced profile.

Still have questions? I'm here to help.
